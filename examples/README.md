This directory contains a series of small examples apps that illustrate how
to code up common use cases for a SLP wallet and managing tokens.

## Running Examples

You can run each example script by entering its directory and executing `npm start`

## General BCH Functions

- [create-wallet](create-wallet) Create a SLP compatible HD Node wallet on
  the BCH mainnet. Send BCH to the address saved in the `wallet.json` file generated by this app.
  All other example apps read this `wallet.json` file.

- [check-balance](check-balance) Check the balance of your BCH wallet. This
  displays both BCH information as well as SLP token information.

## SLP Token Functions

- [lookup-token](lookup-token) Lookup token information based on the token `id`.

- [list-all-tokens](list-all-tokens) List every token in existence.

- [create-token](create-token) - Create an SLP token.
